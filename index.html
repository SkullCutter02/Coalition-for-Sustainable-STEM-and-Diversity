          The Coalition for Minority Empowerment (CME) takes a multi-faceted
          approach to ensuring the migrant domestic worker community is
          supported and empowered. Guided by the SDGs 3, 5, and 10, our
          coalition is a collective movement of holistic wellbeing support that
          aims to reduce inequalities faced by migrant domestic workers. With
          the central goal of fostering the spirit of inclusiveness and respect
          amongst our local and wider communities, a large part of our work
          revolves around the act of sharing. By sharing authentic experiences
          and sparking conversations about minorities, we are able to humanise
          the issue, form connections and nurture empathy, paving the way for
          systemic change in societal mindsets and institutions. In harnessing
          the power of sharing stories, we continue to amplify the voices and
          calls to actions from the community themselves, shedding light on
          struggles faced and their remarkable strength to overcome adversity.
          Another aspect of our advocacy work lies in mobilizing the arts as a
          vehicle for empowerment, self-care and self-expression. Wellbeing is a
          multi-dimensional concept that acts as a support system for all
          individuals to maximise potential. Though mental health has gradually
          become an increasingly prioritised social issue, there is still a gap
          in the services provided for this community. Making a living away from
          home and often being overlooked, the city undoubtedly needs to play a
          larger role in ensuring sufficient resources are allocated to ensuring
          migrant workers maintain healthy and happy lifestyles. Hence, we
          provide support through a diverse range of activities. From
          professional mental health webinars and free financial literacy
          workshops to hosting city-wide art showcases spotlighting migrant
          worker art of different creative mediums, enabling opportunities for
          self-care and self-actualisation remain the forefront mission of our
          organisation.
        </p>

          Lastly, we take an innovative approach in making physical wellbeing
          accessible for migrant workers through martial arts training. Such
          spiritual empowerment is much needed by marginalised community
          members, who endure a dominant sense of inequality in the resources
          they can access and the level of discrimination they face. The martial
          artsâ€™s emphasis on developing control of the mind and body catalyses a
          journey of improved wellbeing, confidence, and self-learned
          empowerment. All in all, despite the diverse and innovative facets of
          advocacy work that our coalition entails, our differences are what
          makes us stronger as advocacy takes its most effective form when
          different perspectives are considered.
