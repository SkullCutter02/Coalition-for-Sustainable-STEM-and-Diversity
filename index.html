            The Coalition for Minority Empowerment (CME) takes a multi-faceted
            approach to ensuring the migrant domestic worker community is
            supported and empowered. Guided by the SDGs 3, 5, and 10, our
            coalition is a collective movement of holistic wellbeing support
            that aims to reduce inequalities faced by migrant domestic workers.
            With the central goal of fostering the spirit of inclusiveness and
            respect amongst our local and wider communities, a large part of our
            work revolves around the act of sharing. By sharing authentic
            experiences and sparking conversations about minorities, we are able
            to humanise the issue, form connections and nurture empathy, paving
            the way for systemic change in societal mindsets and institutions.
            In harnessing the power of sharing stories, we continue to amplify
            the voices and calls to actions from the community themselves,
            shedding light on struggles faced and their remarkable strength to
            overcome adversity.

          <p>
            Another aspect of our advocacy work lies in mobilizing the arts as a
            vehicle for empowerment, self-care and self-expression. Wellbeing is
            a multi-dimensional concept that acts as a support system for all
            individuals to maximise potential. Though mental health has
            gradually become an increasingly prioritised social issue, there is
            still a gap in the services provided for this community. Making a
            living away from home and often being overlooked, the city
            undoubtedly needs to play a larger role in ensuring sufficient
            resources are allocated to ensuring migrant workers maintain healthy
            and happy lifestyles. Hence, we provide support through a diverse
            range of activities. From professional mental health webinars and
            free financial literacy workshops to hosting city-wide art showcases
            spotlighting migrant worker art of different creative mediums,
            enabling opportunities for self-care and self-actualisation remain
            the forefront mission of our organisation.

          <p>
            Lastly, we take an innovative approach in making physical wellbeing
            accessible for migrant workers through martial arts training. Such
            spiritual empowerment is much needed by marginalised community
            members, who endure a dominant sense of inequality in the resources
            they can access and the level of discrimination they face. The
            martial arts’s emphasis on developing control of the mind and body
            catalyses a journey of improved wellbeing, confidence, and
            self-learned empowerment. All in all, despite the diverse and
            innovative facets of advocacy work that our coalition entails, our
            differences are what makes us stronger as advocacy takes its most
            effective form when different perspectives are considered.

              <p>
                The martial arts were historically founded on combating
                oppression and spiritually leveraging practitioners. For
                example, Taekwondo was established and invented by Koreans
                during Japan’s annexation. Karate was born in the Okinawa
                Islands as a form of self-defense, at a time when weapons were
                banned by invading Japanese forces. Such spiritual empowerment
                is much needed by marginalised community members, who endure a
                dominant sense of inequality in the resources they can access
                and the level of discrimination they face. The martial arts’s
                emphasis on developing control of the mind and body is another
                catalyst for such spiritual empowerment, given self-discipline
                is one of its most prominent principles. Kick Action
                democratises the resource of the martial arts, throughout
                technology, filmmaking, and engineering, and offers it in a way
                that emphasizes wellbeing, confidence, and self-learned
                empowerment.

                COEXIST emphasizes on empowering the migrant worker community
                through holistic wellbeing support. Wellbeing is a
                multi-dimensional concept that acts as a support system for all
                individuals to maximise potential. Though mental health has
                gradually become an increasingly prioritised social issue, there

                Making a living away from home and often being overlooked, the
                city undoubtedly needs to play a larger role in ensuring
                sufficient resources are allocated to ensuring migrant workers

                Kick Action also addresses SDG 5 given that the martial arts is
                viewed as a skill that is supposed to be possessed by men,
                because of its inherent violence, and the majority of domestic
                workers being women.

                To achieve equality, one must see oneself as an autonomous
                person capable of controlling one’s destiny. Martial Arts
                provides the physical and spiritual tools to do this through the
                mechanisms used to tackle SDG 3, which allow for reduced
                inequalities and the addressing of SDG 10.

                COEXIST places equality as a priority as evident in our name. We
                reduce inequality by educating employers and students about the
                issues surrounding the migrant worker community in Hong Kong.
                Whether it’s through our blog, art showcase or published
                children’s storybook, they all serve a purpose to shed light on
                the often overlooked community in order to create a culture of
                empathy and respect. Additionally, we provide opportunities for
                the migrant worker community to showcase their existing talents
                and capabilities through cooking workshops which demonstrate and
                acknowledge their role as the backbone of many households in
                Hong Kong. Reducing inequality also involves providing the
                necessary education and skill set to enable migrant workers to
                conduct themselves autonomously without limitations. By
                sponsoring financial literacy workshops, migrant workers are
                able to develop their capabilities in securing their own future
                and livelihood.

                In harnessing the power of sharing stories, Helpers for Helpers
                aims to amplify the voices and calls to actions from domestic
                helpers, through the documentation of their struggles and
                perspectives on Hong Kong. Domestic helpers are the backbone of
                Hong Kong’s ecosystem and provide and sacrifice so much for so
                many Hong Kong families. We expand the reach of their
                experiences to a larger audience and stage, and shed light on
                the discrimination they face socially, economically, and in the
                household. In sharing these stories we hope to highlight the
                lack of respect and mistreatment that many domestic helpers
                suffer from and fight for the respect that domestic helpers
                deserve. Besides posting stories on our social media, we also
                frequently push out new projects. This includes publishing an
                anthology book of our stories and raising $5000 for HELP for
                Domestic Workers, posting video projects and documentaries on
                our social media, and partnering/hosting events and workshops to
                raise discussion and provide empowerment to domestic helpers.
